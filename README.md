# TypeScript Type Error: string[] not assignable to string

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where an array of strings (`string[]`) is passed to a function expecting a single string. The error arises because the function `greeter` is defined to accept a single string argument, but it is called with an array of strings.
